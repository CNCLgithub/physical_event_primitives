# physical_event_primitives
Computational, behavioral, and imaging studies of physical event perception

Stimuli creation branch for experiment on spatiotemporal physical event probes, pioneered by high school research assistant Winnie Chen in summer 2021.

Builds upon the master branch, which was used to create stimuli for prior experiments on physical event probes by Shannon Yasuda (with some input from Tristan Yates and Eivinas Butkus)  

General instructions for creation of stimuli are located here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJ4V6EtBgNww5IrMvxtNqDHQQuABxtDpIWd2z3jbRyg/edit?usp=sharing
